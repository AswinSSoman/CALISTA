CALISTA is a user-friendly toolbox for the analysis of single cell expression data. CALISTA computes four major tasks: 

 1. Identify and characterize different cell types within a heterogeneous population

 2. Reconstruct the lineage relationships
 
 3. Detect the key genes involved in cell-fate transition events

 4. Order individual cells along the reconstructed developmental topology


## System Requirements

CALISTA toolbox is originally written for MATLAB. The subroutines in CALISTA (version 1.0) have been successfully tested on MATLAB 2016b and 2017a. 

CALISTA-R toolbox is also provided for R users. The subroutines in CALISTA (version 1.0) have been successfully tested on R version 3.4.2 and RStudio Version 1.1.383

## Last Update
Current version: 1.0 (26.01.2018)
